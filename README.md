**Documentation of Hunger Games App**

**Introduction**

The Hunger Games application is a game that challenges players to balance three crucial aspects of the creature's well-being: health (soul), hunger, and cleanliness. It's a modern rendition of the classic Tamagotchi game from the 1990s (IIE,2024), where players were tasked with nurturing their virtual pets.

**Purpose**

The Hunger Games application offers an entertaining challenge, tasking players with balancing the creature's well-being to ensure it avoids negative outcomes. Players must strategize to address various needs, understanding that solving one problem may inadvertently neglect another.

The game's objective is to determine the most critical aspect for the creature's well-being. Different users may approach the challenge differently; some may prioritize emotional well-being over cleanliness, while others may focus on satisfying the creature's hunger despite potential negative impacts on its overall well-being.
This dynamic and thought-provoking gameplay encourages players to consider different perspectives and make strategic decisions to achieve balance and success in caring for the creature.

**Design**

The application utilizes a light theme colour scheme and bright images to create a positive and upbeat interface. The homepage features a display image to set the mood, avoiding a serious tone, with the application name "Hunger Games" suggesting that something will be taken care of. An arch design is employed to position the start button, maintaining consistency with the overall theme.
The background sound complements the idea that the user must take care of the creature, enhancing the immersive experience. The subsequent pages maintain the same layout, with vertical alignment of buttons for easy access and animated GIF images that appear as buttons are pressed. This cohesive design approach ensures a visually engaging and user-friendly interface throughout the application.



**Favourite**

The most interesting aspect of the application is the dynamic nature of its emojis and sounds. As buttons are pressed, both the displayed emojis and the accompanying sounds change accordingly. Each button is associated with a specific sound that corresponds to its activity, enhancing the user experience and adding depth to the interaction.

**Github and Github Actions**
GitHub is the perfect place to store the source code as it provides the flexibility to always have the previous code on the cloud should you lose the physical device you were coding with, along with the ability to track the changes that have been made over time. GitHub Actions allow for the code to be verified as an application that can run on any Android device, as it runs tests that allow all those who will view your GitHub to know of its credibility.
